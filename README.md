# E-Commerce Platform Project

This project is focused on developing an e-commerce platform, and it serves as both a technical exercise and a learning tool for understanding how to define requirements for a software project.

## Purpose of the Project

The primary objective of this project is to **learn how to gather, analyze, and document software requirements**. I have created a file called [`requirements.md`](./requirements.md) where I have written detailed requirements for the e-commerce platform. This file serves as a practical example to learn how real-world software projects are planned and documented.

### Why I Created the `requirements.md` File

The reason behind creating the `requirements.md` file is to simulate the process of defining project requirements as it would be done in a professional software development environment. Through this file, I aim to:

1. **Learn to Define Requirements:** Understand the importance of clear, well-structured software requirements and how they guide the development process.
2. **Explore Functional and Non-Functional Requirements:** Identify the specific features that the e-commerce platform should have, as well as constraints like performance, security, and scalability.
3. **Practice Requirements Gathering:** Develop the skill of analyzing user needs, stakeholder input, and business objectives to create a comprehensive requirements document.
4. **Improve My Documentation Skills:** Learn how to effectively communicate the goals and scope of a software project through detailed documentation.

## What I Want to Learn

By creating the `requirements.md` file and working on this project, I aim to learn the following:

- **How to Write Clear and Comprehensive Software Requirements:** This includes both **functional requirements** (what the software should do) and **non-functional requirements** (how the software should perform).
- **How Requirements Influence Development:** I want to understand how the requirements affect the design, architecture, and implementation of the software.
- **Best Practices for Software Documentation:** Learning to document software projects in a way that helps developers, project managers, and stakeholders stay aligned.
- **How to Break Down a Complex Project:** Managing a large-scale project by dividing it into smaller, manageable tasks using the requirements as a guide.

## Project Overview

This e-commerce platform is designed to allow users to:

- Browse products
- Add items to a shopping cart
- Complete a purchase through a secure checkout
- Manage orders in an admin panel

## File Structure

- `requirements.md`: Contains the detailed software requirements for the e-commerce platform.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the project and explains the purpose behind the `requirements.md` file and my learning objectives.

## Installation
